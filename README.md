iterami Overview:
* NEAR: Recommended default. Shows important things that are only visible on the same grid as you.
* FAR: Shows important things that are visible in the entire solar system, such as stations and gates.
* ENEMY: Same as the NEAR tab, except exludes those with Excellent/Good standing, war allies, and alliance/corp/fleet/militia members.
* SECURITY: Shows things relevant for security missions.
* SHIPS: Only shows player-owned ships, including ships that a player has ejected from.
* LOOT: Shows wrecks and shootable things like depots and MTUs.
* MINE: Shows asteroid belts and asteroids.
* ALL: Shows everything. Uses a custom filter since CCP's ALL filter doesn't include everything.
